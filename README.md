# Credit Modeling Using LendingClub Data

This project used LendingClub Data from https://www.lendingclub.com/info/download-data.action

The datasets we use to build credit models contain the information about personal loan data from lending club. The whole raw datasets comprise 151 feature variables (including year tag) and have been separated into different files base on the time period. Based on these raw datasets, a further data cleaning process had been undertaken to serve the following purposes:


1.	Aggregate all datasets into one which will be easy to view, store, and transfer

2.	Select only mortgage loan type

3.	Dump non-relevant variables

Create a dependent variable (Y) which describe whether mortgage has been defaulted by selecting loan type of not current and not paid-in-full; Since we donâ€™t know whether the mortgage is defaulted or not for current loans, we delete those current records.


Processes:


(1) Defining Training Data and Testing Data

Randomly assign samples to two groups. The testing data set consists 30% of the total sample and the training data set consists the other 70% of samples.



(2) Feature Engineering and Selection

First, standardize features in training group using Z-Score standardization method. Then select features using stepwise selection method in training group.


(3) Model Building and Testing

Train the model using data from the training group to get a logistic model that can predict whether one personal will default or not. Then apply the model to the testing data set and calculate the error rate.


(4) K-fold Cross Validation

Randomly assign samples to 4 groups that have the same number of samples. Select one of the groups as testing data set and the other 3 group as training data set.
